Feature: copy file
  As a user
  I want to be able to copy files
  So that I can manage my files

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 1" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"

  Scenario Outline: Copying a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" copies file "/textfile0.txt" to "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

    When user "Alice" copies file "/textfile0.txt" to "/TextFile1.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the content of file "/textfile1.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 1"
    And the content of file "/TextFile1.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"

  Scenario Outline: copy a file into a file at different level received as a group share
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "BRIAN-FOLDER"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "file at second level" to "BRIAN-FOLDER/second-level-file.txt"
    And user "Brian" has shared folder "BRIAN-FOLDER" with group "grp1"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "Sample-Folder-A"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "Sample-Folder-A/sample-folder-b"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "sample file-c" to "Sample-Folder-A/sample-folder-b/textfile-c.txt"
    When user "Alice" copies file "Sample-Folder-A/sample-folder-b/textfile-c.txt" to "BRIAN-FOLDER/second-level-file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Alice" file "Sample-Folder-A/sample-folder-b/textfile-c.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" file "BRIAN-FOLDER/second-level-file.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" file "BRIAN-FOLDER/textfile-c.txt" should not exist
    And the content of file "BRIAN-FOLDER/second-level-file.txt" for user "Alice" should be "sample file-c"
    Examples:
